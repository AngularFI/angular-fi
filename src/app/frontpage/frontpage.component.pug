  h3 About Us

  p This group focuses on&nbsp;
    a(href="https://angularjs.org/") AngularJS
    |  and&nbsp;
    a(href="https://angular.io/") Angular Framework
    | , including Angular 2 and it's future successors. We believe that Angular is here to stay for a long time. We want to focus our efforts on providing knowledge on lesser known Angular features and share knowledge on more advanced Angular topics.

  p This group intends to be a place where you don't need to be a guru to speak. If you've tried something new with Angular, maybe stumbled upon a lesser known module or add-on, we want to hear you share it!
